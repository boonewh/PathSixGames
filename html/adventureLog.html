				As we finished helping the victims of the House of Withering Blossoms, we began discussing what our next move would be. As we were being escorted to the edge of the forest, Miyaro told us about a camp of ronin who might be willing help us and she was willing to lead us to the camp. When we arrived, we quickly noticed that it was full of children and elders, with very few people in the ages between. As we watched children train with bows, we got the impression that the adults were either at war, or had been lost to war. There were many stares as we, foreigners at a strange time, came in with our caravan.
			</p>
				<br>
			<p>
				Miyaro introduced us to Habesuta Hatsu, a woman who met us as we entered the camp. She thought our presence strange, we could tell, but she sent for the leader of the camp, Harabashi Jiro. Jiro met with us, and we told him about our mission to Minkai and that Ameiko, the rightful ruler of the Empire, travelled with us. Jiro made it clear that he did not believe us, but he had a test for us to prove her royal blood. There was a vault in a nearby fortress, a fortress carved into the side of a mountain, that only someone of royal blood could open, if Ameiko could open the vault, he would believe our story. Of course, there was a catch. Bandits were using the fortress as a base and they had made repairs on the structure to make it a formidable structure. Jiro tasked us with dealing with the bandits and told us that a weapon was in the vault. The weapon was a family heirloom and if we could return it, he would help us. 
			</p>
				<br>
			<p>
				Our first move was to scout the area, so Aelfread , Edam and Shalelu went to the area to look around. They managed to get a good look of the outside and return to the group. Shura confidently volunteered to send his earth elemental companion into the middle of the fortress courtyard, the elemental getting there with earth glide. Once the elemental was causing chaos, the party would slip in through the front door. The plan went flawlessly, with Haldir casting knock on the front gate. Once inside, Aelfread went to one tower to take out archers, Edam went to the other tower and Tim led the charge into the main courtyard. As the fighting raged, Shura kept Tim in a standing position and Haldir bounced around the battlefield casting spells and helping to heal when needed. As Edam and Aelfread took out the archers, Tim faced a druid and, we think, a female monk who seemed to be a weretiger. The druid shifted into a imperial magma dragon. With helpful healing and spells, Tim managed the battle in the courtyard, heroically taking the day. Unfortunately the druid and lady tiger walked away from the fight.

			<p>
				We have moved deeper into the fortress, but we continue to find resistance from the bandits. They are definitely not your average bandits. As we moved in, we again encountered the druid and the monk that looks part tiger. They ambushed us as we walked down a hallway. The monk was hiding on the ceiling apparently and dropped directly in front of Edam, surprising him. Bad move for her, she didn&#39;t survive Edam&#39;s wakizashi, and the bandits faced the same fate as Aelfread cut his way through them and Shura bashed a few with his hammer…but once again the druid walked away. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Moving forward, we moved into a room that was obviously a mess hall. The bandits inside stopped eating and looked up as Edam walked into the room. Edam stopped, looked back, and waved at everyone trying to look friendly. They didn&#39;t take it…the room erupted as the bandits rushed the party. While they were coming, Shura cast Blessing of Ferver and Haldir made Edam invisible. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We noticed that there were serving women in the room and the bandits grabbed some of them, using them as shields and threatening them. Haldir touched Aelfread and suddenly Aelfread was across the room and soon after was invisible of his own power. Not long after, Haldir touched Edam and suddenly Edam was across the room. Aelfread and Edam made sure the bandits would never threaten another woman. 
			</p>

				<figcaption>Seinaru Heikiko</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				After making sure the women were okay, we decided it was time to look for the elusive druid. As we moved forward, we found one of the leader&#39;s vials, various organic things that could have been components for druid spells or alchemy. The room also had a very clear pool that the party determined was most likely used for scrying. One of the party picked up a vial and it disturbed the dust on the shelf, which interacted with the moss growing on the ceiling and caused spores to be released into the room. The entire party was coughing and gagging and suffering the effects that included a temporary loss of constitution. After we left the room, we found a room with cages, one of them occupied. We didn&#39;t realize at first, as a girl was buried under furs, bundled and barely conscious. A healing spell from Haldir and she woke up, scared and trying to avoid us. We calmed her down and assured her that we would not harm her. Edam picked the lock on the cage and, after determining that she couldn&#39;t tell us where the druid had gone, took her back to the other women and told her to wait for us to come back and lead them out.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Our search continued, we stumbled upon the secret entrance to the fortress, an illusionary wall. It was an interesting find, but we seemed to have completely lost the druid for the moment. Continuing our search up a staircase, Edam was scouting the way and managed to sneak into a storeroom without being noticed. It was good as he realized that he had snuck his way into the middle of a group waiting to ambush the party. Edam, who lives by a code as a grey paladin, snuck up behind one of the ambushers, drew his swords, stood up and yelled “Hey guys, there&#39;s an ambush in here!” As yet another room erupted around Edam, the party rushed up. The ensuing melee was not easy. Both Shura and Haldir had to tag team healing to keep Tim up as the leader turned out to be an able fighter. In the end though, with Aelfread stalking the room invisibly, Shura swinging his mighty hammer, Haldir casting spells and Tim standing toe to toe with the leader, the party prevailed.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				This was the last of the resistance in the fortress called Seinaru Heikiko. We never found the druid. With the bandits taken care of, we brought Ameiko to the vault in the place and she was able to open it, revealing a large cache of weapons as well as the weapon that Jiro had tasked us with finding. Jiro was grateful and acknowledged Ameiko as heir to the throne, pledging to help us in our quest to restore her to her rightful place. Jiro agreed that the fortress would make a good base of operations, so we moved the samurai and the caravan into the walls of the mountain stronghold.

				The Jade Regent is amassing troops. The governor has been accused of treason and no one knows where the emperor is at. There is a trade crisis as other nations of Tian Xia have become alienated from Minkai. The mercenaries that the Jade Regent has hired, the Typhoon Guard, is costly and taxes have been raised to pay them. The common people suffer the most from these taxes, but no one is happy. So Jiro suggested we visit the Kuroi Yane market. Here three high-ranking ninjas, also known as nokizarusan, or three monkeys, meet every month to discuss matters between the clans. There are many ninja clans in Minkai. At this point Tim brought up the fact that many ninjas have been trying to kill us. Jiro responded by saying that this is exactly why we need to talk to them. The Jade Regent is trying to kill us, ninja simply work for the one who pays the most. Jiro tells us that we need to talk to them and at least convince them to not work with the Jade Regent, even if we do not hire them. The Emerald Branch clan is the most likely to help, as they often champion the cause of freedom. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Haldir teleported everyone to Enganoka and used magic to disguise us as Minkai commoners. He then asked around to find the market building. Once there, we found a line to get in, and we had to pay a bribe to actually get in the door. Once in, we witnessed a Daikan Tetsuku, the local police of Minkai, pull aside a merchant and accuse him of being a smuggler. The officer pulled his sword, forced the merchant to his knees and raised his sword to cut off the man&#39;s head. Edam could not stand by and watch this. He drew his own sword and stopped the downswing. The officer was incensed and immediately attacked Edam. During the combat, Edam was hit by two shuriken coming in from seeming nowhere, but Edam still managed to fell the officer. Suddenly, the officer was not human, as it transformed in death to its true form, an oni. The other Daikan Tetsuku in the area howled in outrage, changed to their natural oni forms, and attacked. Shura most likely saved Edam with a spell that negates critical damage and sneak attack damage, as the shuriken had almost brought Edam to his knees. With Shura&#39;s helping, the party managed to bring down enough oni that the rest fled the area. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The party was then able to continue and find the restaurant where the Three Monkeys met. However, the party was early. Our teleportation meant that we were there before the new moon. However, they were able to find one of the three ninjas. Aelfread was able to talk to him and set an appointment for the upcoming meeting time. Gold was exchanged for a paper detailing the appointment. When the day arrived, we went early and were admitted with no problems. Talking to the Three Monkeys, we found there was a problem. They would not make any deals with us because we already had a mark on our heads. While that mark was in place, they could not deal with us. So now we must deal with this unseen shadow, a master ninja who would have our heads.

				As we continue to look for allies in our fight to return Ameiko&#39;s rightful heritage, Jiro has given us more advice. Jiro claims that the geisha would be important allies, as they have influence with the trade guild and, more importantly, they have lots of information about the local nobility. We needed to talk to O-Kohaku, the owner of the Kiniro Kyomai tea house. Jiro assured us that she could be extremely helpful in our quest. The first problem we ran into was the guards at the gate to the entertainment district, as they took one look at our armor and weapons and decided that we were troublemakers. Luckily, Aelfread and Haldir were able to talk the group past the guards. Once in, we were able to find the teahouse quickly. We were met by an attendant who claimed that O-Kohaku could only been seen through appointment. Jiro had warned us of this and made sure we took a gift. Upon asking to see her by name and telling the attendant that we had a gift, we were escorted to the back. O-Kohaku was sympathetic to our cause, but claimed she was too preoccupied after the disappearance of her most popular geisha. So of course, we offered to help find the girl. With our earnest offer, O-Kohaku gave us a trinket that she claimed the girl, O-Sayumi, had given her before she left and told her that it would help to find her if she didn&#39;t return. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As Shura tried to scry a location, and only got intense blackness, we tried the docks to see if we could hire a ship to take us where the sister was believed to be held by a merchant that claimed she had never made it to his island. The barge that took her and the girl were both missing, and the barge was the only vessel that ever went to the island. It seems that the sailors were afraid of the island. So we decided that we&#39;d have to travel. The trinket that we had been given, an Inro, was carved by a local artist. It had a netsuke carved as a kappa. We used this to find a kappa that O-Sayumi called her uncle. The kappa was able to tell us that O-Sayumi&#39;s mother was killed by this merchant, a pearl merchant who is actually an evil, powerful wizard. The kappa lead us to an old, decrepit boat. The kappa submerged the boat, and it came back up as a functional vessel that we were allowed to use. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Waiting until early the next morning, we rowed to the island under the cover a morning fog. When we arrived, we found a small village of huts. We approached a man with a slight tinge of blue to his skin, asking to talk to him, but he immediately tried to run for the water. Haldir succeeded in Holding him with magic, but it was at this point that Shura noticed something not quite right about the man. He didn&#39;t seem quite…alive, and an aura of evil writhed around him. Haldir still wanted to try to talk, so he released it from the spell, but the thing instantly attacked Haldir, who unsuccessfully tried to cast a spell. Edam jumped into action, his twin wakizashi glinting as he cut the monster down before it could do any more harm to party members. We decided to avoid the village for now and moved our way up to a building that looked like it was once opulent but was falling into disrepair. We found…nothing. Something is not right, as there is no one here and nothing to be found.

				<figcaption>Game Board</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				At the decrepit mansion, we walked into the main building, past two sets of screen walls and into a central room with a large stone table that has a Shogi game on it. Haldur has Permanent Detect Magic now, so he immediately saw that the table was magical, with necromancy and illusion radiating from it. Using his knowledge, he deducted it to be a type of portal. Curious, Haldir reached out and touched a game piece. The entire group suddenly found themselves on a Shogi game board, like pieces in a game, and surrounded by glass like boxes. Aelfread was immediately able to break his box, so Edam and Tim did the same. The noise attracted the other “pieces” on the board…shadows. The shadows attacked and their frigid touch stole the strength of the party. Shura and Haldur had to keep Edam from falling under the weight of his armor after he was touched twice by the undead. With their help, Aelfread, Tim and Edam were able to vanquish the evil undead.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Going down a hallway, we stumbled upon an elderly Tian woman, a servant. She was of no use to us in finding the missing geisha, being terrified of us no matter what we said, so we asked her where the cellar was, and she directed us to the sake cellar. Going downstairs, we found one long hallway and another that ended in darkness. Haldur determined that this was a portal of some sort…and stepped through. Everyone followed and found themselves in a very dark area, where light was almost swallowed. The entire area was drab and...wrong. We only saw in blacks, whites and shades of grey. We did manage to find a gate, however, a moon gate that we had to open to move forward.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				After the gate, we found a room that appeared to be completely empty and unremarkable, but the hairs on the back of our necks were raised…Edam moved slowly into the room and when he got to the center, a noise stopped him in his tracks and suddenly there were more undead…a wraith and more shadows! Edam moved directly to the wraith while the rest of the party took on the shadows. Haldur cast a spell and many of the undead were suddenly corporeal, making them easier to kill. That was the end of the undead. 
			</p>

			<h4>October 7</h4>
			<figure class="logLeftPic">
				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="../images/DreadWraith.png"><img src="../images/DreadWraith.png" alt="Daikan Tetsuku" class="tall"></a>
			</figure>
			<p>
				As the group moved deeper down the hallways, the party slowed down to let Edam scout ahead. However, when Edam discovered a strange hexagonal mirror, he said “nope, looks magic” and went back to the party and described it to the magic types. When Haldir approached it with a light source, suddenly three scorching rays shot out at him, hitting him once. Shocked by the attack, Haldir stepped back and the attacks stopped as the light withdrew from the mirror. Looking closer at the mirror, Edam figured out that it was actually a trap. Ooops…and he disarmed it by shattering the mirror. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Moving further forward, Edam found an empty room. With thoughts of what happened in the last empty room, he edged forward and all of a sudden began to feel vibrations in the floor. The room was dark and Edam, being a Halfling, couldn&#39;t actually see very well, so he started to back out of the room when three big, armored worm-like creatures burst out of the floor and attacked the party. These lizard worms didn&#39;t seem too bad, but then one bit Edam and his skin seemed to turn to shadow and fade away, leaving a gaping wound. The party attacked as a team, Shura smashing with his hammer, Haldir casting evocation spells, Aelfread slicing from invisibility and Edam springing around the creatures and slicing. Haldir was also bit, receiving the same wound that Edam did, but the creatures were quickly overcome. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				This room was a dead end, so the party retraced their steps. As they moved back through the hallway, the came upon the mirror again…except that it was not shattered. It was together. It was still riddled with cracks, but it seemed to be coming back together. We quickly left the area. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Coming back into a room that we had previously fought with undead shadow creatures, we were again attacked…it seemed by the same creatures. This became a theme as we moved through the area, killing a set of undead or a new set of armored worms as we entered new rooms. These repeated attacks by the seemingly the same creatures is wearing on the groups nerves, causing them to search inwardly for answers to what they were going through and what might protect ourselves from these things.

			<h4>October 14</h4>
			<figure class="logRightPic">
				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="../images/nue.png"><img src="../images/nue.png" alt="Nue" class="tall"></a>
				<figcaption>Nue</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Well. We&#39;ve definitely found the puzzle of this area. Multiple curtains, moon gates made of different materials, and lots of hallways present us a problem that we guess can be solved with the use of the Inro that O-Kohaku gave us. Using the items inside it, we move through a silk curtain, then choose one of three moon gates because it is made of green jade and we figure that, since the links in the Inro are blue and yellow, that blue and yellow make green. We then find a curtain made of camphor beads, the last item in the Inro, so we go through. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Going through the curtain, Edam moved stealthily forward and found a room with a strange creature stalking inside. The body of a tiger, head of a monkey and a tail that is a snake…Haldir had knowledge of this creature and told us that it is a Nue and that it&#39;s evil. We walked into the room with the Nue and we see a statue that resembles the picture on the Inru and two women who are both kneeling facing each other in the middle of the room. The Nue immediately cast a spell at Edam, so Edam moved in and attacked it, however when the Nue attacked him physically, it suddenly changed and was a dense, black cloud with “fireworks” in the middle and the cloud was engulfing Edam. Edam moved back, but the cloud moved forward and engulfed him again, and Shura and Tim as well. Suddenly there was a second Nue attacking Haldir.  Once the original Nue changed back to a physical form to attack us, both were dealt with. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Examining the women, we figure out that both are bodies being preserved by gentle repose. Haldir managed to figure out that their souls had been removed. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We moved forward into the next room and found a writing desk and various magic. Collecting what we could, we moved even deeper, moving through another door. We found a dead end that was not a dead end. Haldir&#39;s permanent detect magic gave away an illusion that hid a gateway that seems to traverse the shadow plane. Going through, we are back into an area where colors are muted to grays, blacks and whites. Getting our orientation again, we realize we are in a room with an old Tien man sipping tea and watching us come through the portal. He tells us that we are doing more harm and we needed to go back home, but Edam realized that he radiated extreme evil. Edam asked what harm we would be doing and he told us the story of how O-Sayumi was the daughter of his first wife, and how, because of political positioning, he married again. He had attempted to perform a complex ritual that would have transferred the soul of his second wife into O-Sayumi&#39;s body, but the ritual went wrong and now his wife&#39;s soul wanders the shadow realm. He trapped O-Sayumi&#39;s soul with magic so that he could find his wife&#39;s soul and complete the ritual. 
			</p>

			<h4>October 28</h4>
			<figure class="logLeftPic">
				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="../images/Yugureda_Shosaito.png"><img src="../images/Yugureda_Shosaito.png" alt="Yugureda Shosaito"></a>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The old Tien man is Yugurdea Shosaito. He is not happy that we want to stop him from completing his ritual to give his wife O-Sayumi&#39;s body. We asked about O-Sayumi&#39;s soul, and he sneered at us and scattered thousands of pearls all over the floor, telling us to find her. He then snapped his finger and summoned a shadow. The party sprang into action and Edam killed the shadow, but the old man cast a spell at Haldir that sapped levels. At same time, the lighting in the area dimmed and shadow creatures seemed to spring from our own shadows. The old man disappeared, only to reappear later touching Haldir to try to cast a spell. Haldir felt him try to take control of his mind and maybe soul but resisted it. As Tim began squashing shadows, the old man summoned a derghaodaemon.  
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As Edam and Tim killed shadows, Haldir zipped back and forth across the room casting spells. Then Shura stepped up and banished the daemon back to its home plane. With most of the problems gone, Edam and Tim engaged the old man, with Tim giving the crushing blow from his huge sword. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				With the old man gone, we managed to find the pearl that contained O-Sayumi&#39;s soul in his inro. At that point we looked around and realized that we were in a room with no exit. Haldir cast greater teleport to take us back to the old kappa who had given us advice. There we used magic to restore both O-Sayumi and Taukimi back to their bodies. Taukimi asked to return to her home to repair the damage her husband had done, and we took O-Sayumi back to the teahouse where she was greeted with joy at her return. In return, a number of meetings are now being arranged to help us in our quest to return Ameiko to her rightful throne.

				One of our meetings was with the brother of a powerful Daimyo. This Daimyo was a roadblock in our plans because he was powerful enough to keep others in line. He was a cruel leader, and he had his own army of a hundred soldiers that he used to intimidate others and make sure they supported the Regent. At our meeting, the brother told us that he could not directly oppose his brother, but he wanted to help us where he could. He told us of a hunting lodge his brother frequented and let us know that when his brother went to the hunting lodge, he left his army at a worker&#39;s camp, taking only a few with him as well as his bodyguard and that this was our best chance to take out the daimyo. He also imparted knowledge of seven ronin who had infiltrated the camp to try to assassinate the daimyo themselves. He was sure they would help if we found them. The brother then told us that if we took out his brother, he would be able to step up and take his place. If that happened, he promised to support our cause. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We snuck into the workers camp posing as common Tien, using one of Haldir&#39;s spells to all be flawlessly disguised. Once inside, we managed to find the seven ronin in the camp, as they stood out from the commoners. They agreed that if we snuck into the hunting lodge, they would do their best to keep the army at the workers camp from going to the hunting lodge to try to help if an alarm was sounded. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We snuck into the hunting lodge without issue and immediately dealt with a couple of guards. As we moved deeper into the lodge, we found a door with noises behind it. The sounds were clearly guards and Haldir made the call that we need to take them out, as they might be guarding a door to the daimyo. The party moved quickly into the room, discovering that it was a bunk room, and engaged the guards inside. Haldir cast a Silence spell over most of the room, but one guard still managed to throw a thunderstone through a paper wall, to create a loud noise outside the spell. Thinking that the daimyo might try to run, Edam ran out of the room to try to find him. Haldir also left the room. Edam found the daimyo, realizing that he was actually just on the other side of the paper wall, and engaged him and the bodyguard by himself. After being hit by the bodyguard, Edam regretted his decision, painfully, but didn&#39;t back down, slicing and dicing and healing as he could. Tim came crashing through the paper wall to save the day and help take down both the daimyo and his bodyguard in succession.

			<p>
				After taking down the daimyo and his bodyguard, we decided to quickly search the lodge before leaving. Sneaking down a hallway, Edam heard a soft sobbing coming from inside a small room but could not see the source in the darkness. Going back to the group, Edam told them what he heard and Aelfread and Haldir went to see what was happening. They found a young woman sobbing and tried to talk to her, but something didn&#39;t feel right, and they were very cautious…with reason it turns out. When the girl finally gave up trying to fool us, she left the cage on her own and suddenly what we thought were small balls sitting on shelves around the room burst up and out and showed themselves to be swarms of tiny, fanged heads with wings where their ears should be. We started a fight that could have been difficult, but Haldir cast an electrified fireball and…well, everything was dead. Finding nothing else in the lodge with a quick search, we decided it was time to leave.

				We teleported back to the work camp where one of the ronin got our attention. They had managed to keep the army from moving to the hunting lodge long enough that we could still see them moving away. All involved agreed that it was time to leave the area completely, so we split ways and left. The party once again teleported and went back to talk to Jiro at the fortress headquarters. Jiro congratulated us and told us we should relax and recover for a few days. That night we got a good night’s sleep, but the next days, as we were talking, we suddenly heard a loud, maniacal laugh as something passed in front of the sun, casting a long shadow. We heard an alarm start to sound, but soon a loud explosive sound and the alarm stopped.

				Running outside, we found that the fortress was being attacked! There was a two-headed atamahuta, a really big fire yai, three samurai oni and 3 mage oni. As we gathered for the fight, a round of buffs were cast to prepare us for the fight with everyone who could chipping in to the stack. The began casting their own spells, including tentacles from the ground and an wave of fire. The group then began to move around the battle field, with Aelfread and Tim moving directly out while Edam cast dimension door, taking Haldir and his dog with him to appear behind the group of oni. Shura, after helping buff, smashed oni with his hammer in between really important healing to keep Tim standing upright. In the end, we managed to defeat the attack, vanquishing all the oni.
