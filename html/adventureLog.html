				As we finished helping the victims of the House of Withering Blossoms, we began discussing what our next move would be. As we were being escorted to the edge of the forest, Miyaro told us about a camp of ronin who might be willing help us and she was willing to lead us to the camp. When we arrived, we quickly noticed that it was full of children and elders, with very few people in the ages between. As we watched children train with bows, we got the impression that the adults were either at war, or had been lost to war. There were many stares as we, foreigners at a strange time, came in with our caravan.

				Miyaro introduced us to Habesuta Hatsu, a woman who met us as we entered the camp. She thought our presence strange, we could tell, but she sent for the leader of the camp, Harabashi Jiro. Jiro met with us, and we told him about our mission to Minkai and that Ameiko, the rightful ruler of the Empire, travelled with us. Jiro made it clear that he did not believe us, but he had a test for us to prove her royal blood. There was a vault in a nearby fortress, a fortress carved into the side of a mountain, that only someone of royal blood could open, if Ameiko could open the vault, he would believe our story. Of course, there was a catch. Bandits were using the fortress as a base and they had made repairs on the structure to make it a formidable structure. Jiro tasked us with dealing with the bandits and told us that a weapon was in the vault. The weapon was a family heirloom and if we could return it, he would help us.

				Our first move was to scout the area, so Aelfread , Edam and Shalelu went to the area to look around. They managed to get a good look of the outside and return to the group. Shura confidently volunteered to send his earth elemental companion into the middle of the fortress courtyard, the elemental getting there with earth glide. Once the elemental was causing chaos, the party would slip in through the front door. The plan went flawlessly, with Haldir casting knock on the front gate. Once inside, Aelfread went to one tower to take out archers, Edam went to the other tower and Tim led the charge into the main courtyard. As the fighting raged, Shura kept Tim in a standing position and Haldir bounced around the battlefield casting spells and helping to heal when needed. As Edam and Aelfread took out the archers, Tim faced a druid and, we think, a female monk who seemed to be a weretiger. The druid shifted into a imperial magma dragon. With helpful healing and spells, Tim managed the battle in the courtyard, heroically taking the day.
