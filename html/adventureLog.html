				As we finished helping the victims of the House of Withering Blossoms, we began discussing what our next move would be. As we were being escorted to the edge of the forest, Miyaro told us about a camp of ronin who might be willing help us and she was willing to lead us to the camp. When we arrived, we quickly noticed that it was full of children and elders, with very few people in the ages between. As we watched children train with bows, we got the impression that the adults were either at war, or had been lost to war. There were many stares as we, foreigners at a strange time, came in with our caravan.
			</p>
				<br>
			<p>
				Miyaro introduced us to Habesuta Hatsu, a woman who met us as we entered the camp. She thought our presence strange, we could tell, but she sent for the leader of the camp, Harabashi Jiro. Jiro met with us, and we told him about our mission to Minkai and that Ameiko, the rightful ruler of the Empire, travelled with us. Jiro made it clear that he did not believe us, but he had a test for us to prove her royal blood. There was a vault in a nearby fortress, a fortress carved into the side of a mountain, that only someone of royal blood could open, if Ameiko could open the vault, he would believe our story. Of course, there was a catch. Bandits were using the fortress as a base and they had made repairs on the structure to make it a formidable structure. Jiro tasked us with dealing with the bandits and told us that a weapon was in the vault. The weapon was a family heirloom and if we could return it, he would help us. 
			</p>

				Our first move was to scout the area, so Aelfread , Edam and Shalelu went to the area to look around. They managed to get a good look of the outside and return to the group. Shura confidently volunteered to send his earth elemental companion into the middle of the fortress courtyard, the elemental getting there with earth glide. Once the elemental was causing chaos, the party would slip in through the front door. The plan went flawlessly, with Haldir casting knock on the front gate. Once inside, Aelfread went to one tower to take out archers, Edam went to the other tower and Tim led the charge into the main courtyard. As the fighting raged, Shura kept Tim in a standing position and Haldir bounced around the battlefield casting spells and helping to heal when needed. As Edam and Aelfread took out the archers, Tim faced a druid and, we think, a female monk who seemed to be a weretiger. The druid shifted into a imperial magma dragon. With helpful healing and spells, Tim managed the battle in the courtyard, heroically taking the day. Unfortunately the druid and lady tiger walked away from the fight.

				We have moved deeper into the fortress, but we continue to find resistance from the bandits. They are definitely not your average bandits. As we moved in, we again encountered the Druid and the monk that looks part tiger. They ambushed us as we walked down a hallway. The monk was hiding on the ceiling apparently and dropped directly in front of Edam, surprising him. Bad move for her, she didn&#39;t survive Edam&#39;s wakizashi, and the bandits faced the same fate as Aelfread cut his way through them and Shura bashed a few with his hammer…but once again the druid walked away. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Moving forward, we moved into a room that was obviously a mess hall. The bandits inside stopped eating and looked up as Edam walked into the room. Edam stopped, looked back, and waved at everyone trying to look friendly. They did&#39;t take it…the room erupted as the bandits rushed the party. While they were coming, Shura cast Blessing of Ferver and Haldir made Edam invisible. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We noticed that there were serving women in the room and the bandits grabbed some of them, using them as shields and threatening them. Haldur touched Aelfread and suddenly Aelfread was across the room and soon after was invisible of his own power. Not long after, Haldir touched Edam and suddenly Edam was across the room. Aelfread and Edam made sure the bandits would never threaten another woman.

			<p>
				After making sure the women were okay, we decided it was time to look for the elusive druid. As we moved forward, we found the of one of the leaders that had a bed, vials, various organic things that could have been components for druid spells or alchemy. The room also had a very clear pool that the party determined was most likely used for scrying. One of the party picked up a vial and it disturbed the dust on the shelf, which interacted with the moss growing on the ceiling and caused spores to be released into the room. The entire party was coughing and gagging and suffering the effects that included a temporary loss of constitution. After we left the room, we found a room with cages, one of them occupied. We didn&#39;t realize at first, as a girl was buried under furs, bundled and barely conscious. A healing spell from Haldir and she woke up, scared and trying to avoid us. We calmed her down and assured her that we would not harm her. Edam picked the lock on the cage and, after determining that she couldn&#39;t tell us where the druid had gone, took her back to the other women and told her to wait for us to come back and lead them out.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Our search continued, we stumbled upon the secret entrance to the fortress, an illusionary wall. It was an interesting find, but we seemed to have completely lost the druid for the moment. Continuing our search up a staircase, Edam was scouting the way and managed to sneak into a storeroom without being noticed. It was good as he realized that he had snuck his way into the middle of a group waiting to ambush the party. Edam, who lives by a code as a grey paladin, snuck up behind one of the ambushers, drew his swords, stood up and yelled “Hey guys, there&#39;s an ambush in here!” As yet another room erupted around Edam, the party rushed up. The ensuing melee was not easy. Both Shura and Haldir had to tag team healing to keep Tim up as the leader turned out to be an able fighter. In the end though, with Aelfread stalking the room invisibly, Shura swinging his mighty hammer, Haldir casting spells and Tim standing toe to toe with the leader, the party prevailed.

				This was the last of the resistance in the fortress called Seinaru Heikiko. We never found the druid. With the bandits taken care of, we brought Ameiko to the vault in the place and she was able to open it, revealing a large cache of weapons as well as the weapon that Jiro had tasked us with finding. Jiro was grateful and acknowledge Ameiko as heir to the throne, pledging to help us in our quest to restore her to her rightful place. Jiro agreed that the fortress would make a good base of operations, so we moved the samurai and the caravan into the walls of the mountain stronghold.
