					<h3>We Have Arrived In Tian Xia!</h3>
					<p>Thank you for joining our party of adventures as they lead a caravan into the mysterious lands of Tian Xia. After 
						making our way through the Forest of Spirits, and investigating the House of the Withered Blossoms, we have arrived in Minkai to help our friend Ameiko regain her lost heritage.

					<p>We are playing the "Jade Regent" Adventure Path sold by Paizo, Inc.</p>
						<blockquote>
							When a decades-old secret is exposed, an unassuming local tavern-owner and a close friend of 
							the PCs discovers her birthright is to rule one of the ancient Dragon Empires of Tian Xiaâ€”the 
							empire of Minkai. Yet the current ruler of this empire, the mysterious and increasingly cruel 
							Jade Regent, has no intention of giving up his hold over the throne. In order to save Minkai 
							from a would-be tyrant, the PCs must not only escort their friend from Varisia to Tian Xia, 
							braving the frozen horrors of the Crown of the World, but must aid her in gaining the trust 
							and support of a nation on the edge of anarchy.

					<h3>Our Game</h3>
					<p>
						Our group currently consists of a storyteller and five players. Our <a href="html/rules.html"><b>house rules</b></a> are all a result of group 
						discussion and consensus. Not everyone would enjoy our game, but we have a ton of fun. For example, if you
						read the <a href="html/rules.html"><b>house rules</b></a>, you might notice that we banned a lot of classes, including
						the basic fighter class. This was based on our group playstyle where min maxed fighters could dominate the 
						game. It was not done to punish a single player or even as a negative rule, but an agreement among the group 
						that by removing this class, we'd have more fun as a whole. It's not perfect, especially with the gestalt
						builds that we are playing with now, but it's what we want for our game. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Speaking of Gestalt leveling rules, they derive from the D&D 3.5 ruleset. If you have never heard of it, you can 
						read about the rules here:
